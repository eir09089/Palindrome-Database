# Palindrome-Database
A  service that stores a number of palindromes. The service has a simple REST interface that presents two endpoints:
An endpoint that accepts a string parameter, that will return true if the string is palindrome (and false otherwise)
An endpoint that returns a list of the last 10 palindromes the system has received in the last 10 minutes.
